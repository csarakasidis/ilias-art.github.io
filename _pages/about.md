<p style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; text-align: justify"><b>Absence of a detailed CV is a personal choice. Shows lack of interest for the creation of a "brand" and complete indifference for the rules of contemporary Art market. The magic exists inside the creation and not the trade of artworks.</b>

<p style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; text-align: justify">
I was borned and raised in Greece. Studied Mathematics & Physics at Munich, Germary, however philosophy have always been the "mistress" of my mind.
<br>
<br>
Artistically, I enjoy moving from specific to abstract and from reality to illusion. Usually I philosophize without strict conclusions. I always enjoy implying them though. I am mainly interested to the non-existent, something that has not been created before.
<br>
<br>
Why sculpture though? Because I couldn't find the sculptures I wanted to see, I started creating them for myself.
<br>
<br>
Art has all those characteristics that makes it a dynamic under continuous evolvement "religion". Its believers consist of dilettantes, ministers are the artists and Museums are the temples. Therefore I am an Art minister. Every art creation after has been completed is independent to speak directly to the viewer. This interaction can end up being just a flirt, or even more love. The artist isn't part of this anymore.
<br>
<br>
Usually a sort narrative follows my artworks, so the viewer can feel closer to the origin of the idea it was born. I wholeheartedly believe that the "conceptual environment" of an artwork is an integral part of it.
<br>
<br>
It is well-known that public relations and good networking sometimes work as a substance to the absence of talent. The line between art and deception is thin and sometimes becomes invisible. Every artist is being judged for each artwork separately, no matter how great they are. The signature, shouldn't be part of their beacon. It's irrational to judge a piece of art based solely on the signature that it carries.
<br>
<br>
My artworks are for sale, as well as for renting to public or private Museums.
<br>
<br>
Epilogue: I create, hence I exist.
